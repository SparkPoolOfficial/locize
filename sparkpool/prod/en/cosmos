      "a1": "Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by classical BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint. The first blockchain in the Cosmos Network is the Cosmos Hub, whose native token is the Atom. Cosmos is a permissionless network, meaning that anybody can build a blockchain on it.",
      "a10": "We have worldwide nodes",
      "a11": "Of course. We are closely linked to the interests of our clients.",
      "a12": "In this phase, we strongly recommend that you do not arrange to trade Atoms (eg. by legal contract as they will not be transferable yet) as there is the risk of state being reverted.",
      "a13": "Please do not use Voyager at the launch of Cosmos, it is currently in alpha and undergoing development. A separate announcement will be made once Voyager is safer for use.",
      "a14": "We charge 4% at the beginning of mainnet launch.  ",
      "a15": "https://cosmos.network/",
      "a16": "No. You can undelegate whenever you want, but notice that as a safety mechanism in protocol, you need to wait 3 weeks to retrieve your Atoms.",
      "a17": "If a delegator wants to undelegate part or all of their stake, they needs to send an “Undelegate transaction”. From there, the delegator will have to wait 3 weeks to retrieve their Atoms. Delegators can also send a “Rebond Transaction” to switch from one validator to another, without having to go through the 3 weeks waiting period.",
      "a2": "A delegator is an Atom holder who wants to stake but cannot or does not want to run a validator node. Users can delegate their Atoms to validators and earn income. Once delegation succeeds, the delegator and the validator will share the reward as well as their responsibility. If a validator doesn't behave under the protocol, delegators who delegate Atom to him will be penalized proportionally to their staked Atom. Make sure you choose wisely a reliable validator.",
      "a3": "The Cosmos Hub is based on Tendermint, which relies on a set of validators to secure the network. The role of validators is to run a full-node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by their private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work. They must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.",
      "a4": "Block provisions: Native tokens of applications run by validators (e.g. Atoms on the Cosmos Hub) are inflated to produce block provisions. These provisions exist to incentivize Atom holders to bond their stake, as non-bonded Atom will be diluted over time.\nBlock rewards: For the Ethermint zone, block rewards are paid in Photons. Initial distribution of Photons will be hard spooned from Ethereum. This means Photons will be emitted 1:1 to Ether.\nTransaction fees: The Cosmos Hub maintains a whitelist of token that are accepted as fee payment.",
      "a5": "If you participated in the fundraiser, you can check your suggested atom balance at fundraiser.cosmos.network. If not, you have to wait until the Cosmos Network launches and Atoms are traded on exchanges.",
      "a6": "Public, decentralized networks require high levels of security and spam-prevention that are best achieved by economic means: participants in the consensus must incur some economic cost, and all transactions processed by the network must pay a fee. Since we want to use Proof-of-Stake validators instead of Proof-of-Work miners, we require validators of the Cosmos Hub to make a large security deposit in Atoms - if they misbehave, their Atoms are revoked by the protocol! The more Atoms in security deposits, the more stake on the line; the more skin-in-the-game; the greater the economic security. ",
      "a7": "A validator has an active key involved in signing votes in the consensus protocol. A validator must also have some Atoms in a security deposit. Since there will only be a limited number of validators, other Atom holders can delegate to the validators, thereby contributing to the economic security of the system by putting their funds on the line if the validator misbehaves. In return, they earn a share of the transaction fees and any inflationary rewards.",
      "a8": "Out of all the candidates that signaled themselves, the 100 with the most stake are the ones who are designated as validators. If a validator’s total stake falls below the top 100 then that validator loses its validator privileges. Over time, the maximum number of validators will increase to 300.",
